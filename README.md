## Challenge A : Array Reversal

#### There is an array, and we need to reverse the order of its elements. The goal is to return a new array that contains all the elements of the original array, but in reverse order.

## Challenge B : Most Frequent Number

#### We need to write a function that takes an array of numbers and finds the number that appears the most. If all numbers are different, return the first number, but If two or more numbers appear the same number of times, return the one that comes first in the array.
